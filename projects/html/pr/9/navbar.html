                The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn'
                t distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler text can be 
                very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.
                
                The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets,
                 and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen all around the 
                 web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to get your own, or read on for the authoritative history 
                 of lorem ipsum.
                
                
                Origins and Discovery
                Lorem ipsum began as scrambled, nonsensical Latin derived from Cicero's 1st-century BC text De 
                Finibus Bonorum et Malorum.

                Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born as a nonsense text. “It's not Latin
                , though it looks like it, and it actually says nothing,” Before & After magazine answered a curious reader,
                 “Its ‘words’ loosely approximate the frequency with which letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it 
                  pretty real.”
                
                As Cicero would put it, “Um, not so fast.”
                
                The placeholder text, beginning with the line “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit”,
                 looks like Latin because in its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin.
                
                Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is credited with discovering the sourcehereabouts 
                s Cicero would put it, “Um, not so fast.”
